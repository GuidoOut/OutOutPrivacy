Fabble uses the Unity Leaderboards API to record scores and generate leaderboards. This means these data points are collected:

User ID
Such as screen name, handle, account ID, assigned user ID, customer number, or other user- or account-level ID that can be used to identify a particular user or account.

Coarse Location
Information that describes the location of a user or device with lower resolution than a latitude and longitude with three or more decimal places, such as approximate location services.
