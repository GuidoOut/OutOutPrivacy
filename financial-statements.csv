1;0;I see you have made it to the starting location. Now to prove that you are worthy of a spot on my crew you have to collect some intel for me.;0;;;;;1;2;;This field is not used in the game but can be used by us to take notes about the scavenger hunt
2;0;First one is an easy one. Here at the marine fort we are going to do a raid. But I need to know how many doors we can force ourself into at the same time from the water to catch our enemies by surprise.;0;;;;;1;3;;
3;0;How many doors are there on the water level on the street side?;1;5;Number of doors;10;;2;5;4;
4;0;No, that doesn't seem right. Check again;0;;;;;;3;;
5;0;<j>Good...</j> That information will serve me well when we prepare our attack. Now move across the Kattenburgerbrug along the water following the harbor. When you see my favorite tattooshop across the street on the corner you will cross the street.;0;;;;;3;5;;
6;0;Ah that takes me back to the time I got an anchor tattooed on my<w>......</w>  Never mind just go. If you have trouble finding it just look for some grapes above the door.;0;;;;;5;7;;
7;0;You are now at the Prins Hendrikkade. A famous admiral lives here that is hunting us pirates at any chance he gets. I need to know which house he lives in. ;0;;;;;6;8;;
8;0;Just keep moving along the harbor in the direction you were walking before. But look out for this scums house and give me the number of his address.;1;87;House number;10;;7;10;9;
9;0;No that's where your mom lives. I know that number far too well...;0;;;;;;7;;
10;0;Perfect. I will send some people around and kidnap his family while he is out on the sea. Thank you. <br> <br> Now keep on walking further down the harbor.;0;;;;;7;11;;
11;0;It is said a famous explorer will leave on a grand voyage somewhere around here. I need some new weapons and rations for my own ships and I bet his ships will be filled to the brim before he sets sail. Find out the date he will set sail so we can plunder it the day before.;0;;;;;10;12;;
12;0;Have you figured out the date of his departure already?;2;april 4 1609;May 3 1610|March 12 1615|April 4 1609|June 9 1608;15;;11;14;13;
13;0;I've heard other reports, so I'll have to check again with someone more ... reputable than you... Keep moving;0;;;;;;14;;
14;0;That confirms my suspicions, we'll post a group of men here on that date;0;;;;;;15;;
15;;Now walk in the direction of De Waag.;0;;;;;12;16;;
16;;The masons will show you the way. Find the mason and enter the street he is facing. Now in this street take the first street on your port side. If you pass the gate of dragons you have gone to far. Now that you have entered this street go find the Old Sailor.;;;;;;;;;
17;;Now that you found the Old Sailor ...;;;;;;;;;
18;;You found the church. Now find ‘The Old Forge*’ and take that street BUT on the opposite side of the water.;;;;;;;;;
19;;In this street another famous Admiral lives. Give me his home address so I can plunder his riches.;;;;;;;;;
